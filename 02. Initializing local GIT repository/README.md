# 2. Initializing local GIT repository
1. We will create a local GIT repository in the folder with the sample project from first exercise 
2. Navigate to your folder using command-line and `cd` command
3. Execute `git init` command in the folder
	- This command will create a local GIT repository
	- GIT will create hidden .git folder (this is a folder GIT is using to maintain your local repository - you do not need to touch this folder, you will be using only GIT commands to work with you repository)
